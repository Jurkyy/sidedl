### Deep Learning Software for Side-Channel Analysis

Effectively a continuation on the [SCA-toolbox](https://github.com/AISyLab/side-channel-analysis-toolbox), but then in the realm of Deep Learning (DL) and other AI methods. 
It has many additional features compared to the SCA-toolbox, such as directly reading from many different types of (custom) datasets and types (.h5, .yaml, SQL DB), the automation of optimizing networks, and all the possible analysis tools. Sadly, due to a lack of funding this project never got publisized, but it is still a great tool none the less.
